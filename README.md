The goal of the Kaggle Cancer CNN mini-project is to develop a CNN model to accurately classify images of metastatic cancer in small image
patches. The project utilizes the CNN machine learning method to accomplish this task, and the necessary data is downloaded from the Kaggle
website at https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection.
The data is composed of images that are named with an image ID, and a positive label indicates that a patch of one pixel has tumor tissue.
However, it is important to note that the data contains duplicates. In order to properly analyze and model this data, the EDA (Exploratory Data
Analysis) process involves removing the duplicate images and reviewing the label quality with a histogram.
After cleaning the data, the next step is to develop the CNN model and tune it to improve its ability to generalize. This involves training the
model on the cleaned data and experimenting with different hyperparameters to increase the accuracy of the model.
Once the model is trained, the project reviews its accuracy and evaluates its overall performance. This provides insight into the effectiveness of
the CNN model for classifying images of metastatic cancer in small image patches.
In conclusion, the Kaggle Cancer CNN mini-project demonstrates the ability to accurately classify images of metastatic cancer using a CNN
model. Through careful cleaning and analysis of the data, the project provides a valuable example of how to develop and train a CNN model for
real-world applications.
